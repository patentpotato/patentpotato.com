    <p>When companies negotiate to buy or sell software, they often get hung up on the patent problem. Who will pay—“represent”, “warrant”, and “indemnify”—if it turns out somebody has a patent on the software and threatens to sue?</p>
    <p>Nobody knows all the patents out there. Thanks to rules that put you on the hook for <em>more</em> money if you know about a patent, nobody’s in a big rush to read up, either. But with companies out there doing nothing but buying patents and sending demand letters to everyone and their brother, nobody can ignore the risk.</p>
    <p>So negotiators spend hours on the phone repeating the same old arguments. Then they delay deals for days or weeks waiting on the same old markups. Because nobody has a solution to the problem. It comes down to who’s getting stuck with it, and by how much.</p>
    <p>Here’s a <a href="#approaches">list of approaches I’ve seen in the wild</a>, a <a href="#checklist">checklist</a> of other points for your terms, plus some <a href="#reading">good reading</a> from old hands in the game. They can help you break through and get a good deal done.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt id="vendor">Vendor Takes It</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The vendor takes all the risk. Often involves a price hike.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="customer">Customer Takes It</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The customer takes all the risk. Often involes a pretty good price deal for the customer, who may have access to mitigations like patent pools or insurance-like products that the vendor doesn’t.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3 id="words">Words</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt id="known">Known</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Put the vendor on the hook for issues with patents they knew about on delivery, or learned about without notifying the customer.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="should">Should Have Known</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Put the vendor on the hook for patents they knew about, and also patents they should have known about. Entitles both paties to have a big fight about “should have” or “reasonably should have” during settlement negotiatoins.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3 id="dollars">Dollars</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt id="cap">Cap</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Put the vendor on the hook, but limit their liability. Sometimes the same limit applies to patent problems as to other problems under the contract. Sometimes it’s distinct. Often set at the fees the vendor earned in the last twelve months before the claim.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="insurnace">Insurance</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Vendor agrees to carry insurance-like protection, often from RPX. Often passed through in whole or in part via pricing.</p>

    </dl>
    <h3 id="creative">Creative</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt id="fto">FTO</dt>
      <dd>If the customer has a freedom-to-operate analysis process, have the vendor promise to provide them the input they need before delivery. Give the customer the ability to back out if they spot an issue.</dd>
      <dt id="offense">Offense</dt>
      <dd>Both sides agree to make coordinated donations to a political or industry group pursuing patent reform legislation, compiling prior art in the field, or actively opposing patents and applications.</dd>

    <p>When companies negotiate to buy or sell software, they often get hung up playing patent potato. Who will pay—“represent”, “warrant”, and “indemnify”—if it turns out somebody has a patent on the software and threatens to sue?</p>
    <p>No one knows all the patents out there. Thanks to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2018-title35/pdf/USCODE-2018-title35-partIII-chap29-sec284.pdf">rules that put you on the hook for <em>more</em> money if you know about the patent you’re caught infringing</a>, no one’s in a big rush to find out, either. But with companies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_assertion_entity">doing nothing but buying patents and sending demand letters</a>, no one can ignore the risk.</p>
    <p>Negotiators spend hours on the phone repeating the same old arguments. They delay their deals for days and weeks trading the same old markups. With no creative solutions to offer, it comes down to who’s getting stuck with it, and by how much.</p>
    <p>Here’s a <a href="#approaches">list of approaches I’ve seen in the wild</a>, <a href="#checklists">checklists of other points to keep in mind</a>, plus some <a href="#reading">good reading from old hands in the game</a> and a <a href="#organizations">list of organizations offering risk-mitigation services</a>. They can help you break through and get a good deal done.</p>

    <h3 id="hardline">Hardline</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt id="vendor">Vendor Takes It</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The vendor takes all the risk. In essence, they write their customer a private insurance policy to cover patent risk. Often involves a price hike.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="customer">Customer Takes It</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The customer takes all the risk. Often involves a pretty inexpensive product or service. Occasionally results from a customer having access to mitigations like patent pools or insurance-like products.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3 id="words">Words</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt id="known">Known</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Put the vendor on the hook for issues with patents they knew about on delivery, or learned about without notifying the customer.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="should">Should Have Known</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Put the vendor on the hook for patents they knew about, and also patents they should have known about. Entitles both parties to have a big fight about “should have” or “reasonably should have” during settlement negotiations.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="issued">Issued Only</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Put the vendor on the hook for patents issued as of the date of the agreement only, or issued patents and published patent applications.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3 id="dollars">Dollars</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt id="cap">Cap</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Put the vendor on the hook, but limit their liability. Sometimes the same limit applies to patent problems as to other problems under the contract. Sometimes it’s distinct. Often set at the fees the vendor earned in the last twelve months before the claim.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt id="insurnace">Insurance</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Vendor agrees to carry insurance-like protection from a specialist carrier. Often passed through in whole or in part via pricing. The indemnity in the contract between vendor and customer may be rewritten to match the scope and limits of the policy.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3 id="creative">Creative</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt id="fto">FTO</dt>
      <dd>If the customer has a freedom-to-operate analysis process, have the vendor promise to provide them the input they need before delivery. Give the customer the ability to back out if they spot an issue.</dd>
      <dt id="offense">Offense</dt>
      <dd>Both sides agree to make coordinated donations to a political or industry group pursuing patent reform legislation, compiling prior art in the field, or actively opposing patents and applications.</dd>
